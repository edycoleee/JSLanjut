            <p>The first ascent, made in June from the Paris Observatory, though a lofty one, was attended with so much
                danger and confusion as to be barren of results. The departure, owing to stormy weather, was hurried and
                illordered, so that the velocity in rising was excessive, the net constricted the rapidly-swelling
                globe, and the volumes of out-rushing gas half-suffocated the voyagers. Then a large rent occurred,
                which caused an alarmingly rapid fall, and the two philosophers were reduced to the necessity of
                flinging away all they possessed, their instruments only excepted.</p>
